In contrast to classic poker games, SNAP is designed to reduce the time between a fold and a new round. In other words, you can play much more hands in shorter space of time! SNAP rules are exactly the same as in Texas Hold’em poker, but instead of playing at one same table against the same opponents for the duration of your session, you become part of a pool of interchanging players. </p>
<p>So, how does it work? As soon as you make a decision not to play a hand and fold your cards, you are placed at a different table with new opponents and new cards in a matter of seconds. This fast-paced game is also available on mobile, so that you can play SNAP games while on the move.</p>
</div></div></div><div class="nano stage__step js-step"><div class="nano-content"><h3 class="step__title">Quick Start</h3><div itemprop="articleBody" class="modal__description--text"><p>In SNAP poker, a player automatically joins a players’ pool and is randomly re-seated at a different table in every hand they play. The game is played with the same rules as Texas Hold’em using a  deck of 52 cards with no jokers. Each player is dealt two face-down cards, also known as “hole cards”. Five community cards are dealt face up on the poker table across three rounds. The rounds are called “flop”, “turn” and “river”. The money pot (chips) is formed by players acting over the course of four betting rounds: pre-flop, flop, turn and river.</p>
</div></div></div><div class="nano stage__step js-step"><div class="nano-content"><h3 class="step__title">Aim</h3><div itemprop="articleBody" class="modal__description--text"><p>The hand is a player&#39;s best five-card combination. Players can use both, one or none of their two hole cards to form the best hand. If a player does not use any of their hole cards, they are said to be ‘playing the board’. All five community cards on the table would make up the best possible hand combination for that player.</p>

You can do it by clicking the “SNAP” tab on the top right-hand side when you open the 888poker Main Lobby. It will take you to the SNAP Main Lobby where you will be presented with two options. You can choose to play cash games or tournaments.</p>
<p>After choosing your game format, you can double click on any available player pools. By clicking the “Join Game” button, you will be added to that game and seated at a table with random players in the same pool.</p>
<p>Once all players are seated at the table with their relevant chip stacks, there are a few more steps before the game can start. </p>
<p>Firstly, a player indicated by ‘the dealer’ button (‘D&#39;) is named as the dealer for the current hand.
Secondly, two mandatory bets are placed. The player to the left of the dealer button posts the first forced bet, called ‘the small blind’. The player to the left of the small blind posts the second forced bet, called ‘the big blind’. The big blind is twice the amount of the small blind.</p>
<p>Finally, each player is dealt two face-down hole cards.</p>
</div></div></div><div data-nav="snap_deal_1" data-position="snap_deal_1" class="nano stage__step js-step snap_deal_1"><div class="nano-content"><h2 class="step__title">Dealer</h2><div class="modal__description--text"><p>The Dealer is a table position assigned to the player who acts last in all betting rounds except pre-flop – as long as they choose to play the hand. It is also known as the ‘dealer button’ or simply the ‘button’ and is indicated by a ‘D’ marker. The dealer position is important because it determines the order in which players can act.</p>
<p>The dealer is known to be the best table position. The player in the dealer position can observe the actions of their opponents before it&#39;s their turn to act. It allows the player to analyse their opponents and make decisions based on their previous actions.</p>
<p>In SNAP poker, you can never predict when you will be the dealer for a specific hand, because you are randomly re-seated at a new table as soon as the hand ends, or you decide to fold.</p>
</div></div></div><div data-nav="snap_deal_2" data-position="snap_deal_2" class="nano stage__step js-step snap_deal_2"><div class="nano-content"><h2 class="step__title">Small Blind</h2><div class="modal__description--text"><p>The small blind, marked as SB, is the first of the two initial forced bets in a game of Texas Hold&#39;em. It is placed by the player immediately to the left of the dealer, and rotates after each hand to the next player, in a clockwise fashion. In a $10/$20 No Limit (NLHE) game, the small blind is equal to $10. However, in a Fixed Limit NLHE game, the SB is equal to one-half of the selected table’s lower betting limit. For example, if a table’s betting stake is $10/$20, the small blind would be $5.</p>
</div></div></div><div data-nav="snap_deal_3" data-position="snap_deal_3" class="nano stage__step js-step snap_deal_3"><div class="nano-content"><h2 class="step__title">Big Blind</h2><div class="modal__description--text"><p>The big blind, marked as BB, is the second of the two initial mandatory bets. It is placed by the player immediately to the left of the small blind, and rotates after each hand to the next player, in a clockwise fashion.

For example, if a table’s betting stake is $10/$20, the small blind would be $10.</p>
<p>In NLHE games, the amount of the big blind is also the minimum bet in the current betting round. The small and big blinds are important because they incite the action and get the game going, since there&#39;s already money to vie for in the pot.   </p>

If all players decide to check in the current betting round, meaning there are no new bets, the amount in the pot remains the same as after the turn betting round. If all players, except one, decide to fold in the current round, the player who has not folded wins the pot, and the betting round ends.   </p>

However, you can use this to your advantage and play more aggressively. Remember that your opponents don’t know what type of player you are either, so you can bluff or raise with a bit more confidence, even if you don’t have the best cards. </p>
</div></div></div><div class="nano stage__step js-step"><div class="nano-content"><h3 class="step__title">Tip 2</h3><div class="modal__description--text"><p>Since it is very easy to fold a hand in SNAP, there is less temptation to play less than decent cards. Of course, some people can choose to raise every time.However, most players will probably decide not to play “junk” and move on to playing the next hand at a new table. Watch out when players raise in early position, particularly those who act first in betting rounds, as they usually have a hand. </p>
