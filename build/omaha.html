Players can bet any amount up to the current amount in the pot. PLO is a great game for beginners to learn all about forming different types of poker hands. </p>
<p>You might be surprised to learn that this poker variant was not created in the city of Omaha, Nebraska, USA. In fact, the city really has nothing to do with the game, except for sharing the same name. The first record of Omaha Hi being played in Las Vegas dates back to 1982. Before that, a variation of the game was played with five individual cards dealt to each player. However, this format limited the number of players who could participate, as there are only 52 cards in a deck. So, the game evolved into all players being dealt four starting cards, of which only two cards can be used to make a hand – along with a five-card community board.</p>
</div></div></div><div class="nano stage__step js-step"><div class="nano-content"><h3 class="step__title">Quick Start</h3><div itemprop="articleBody" class="modal__description--text"><p>Omaha Hi is played by two to ten people using a deck of 52 cards with no jokers. Each player is dealt four face-down cards at the beginning of the game, also known as ‘hole cards’. Five community cards are dealt face up in three rounds at the poker table. The rounds are called “flop”, “turn” and “river”. The money in the pot (chips) is built by the players over four betting rounds: pre-flop, flop, turn and river.</p>
</div></div></div><div class="nano stage__step js-step"><div class="nano-content"><h3 class="step__title">Aim</h3><div itemprop="articleBody" class="modal__description--text"><p>The aim is to win the money/chips in the pot by forming a better five-card combination (known as the hand) than the rest of the players; or by convincing the other players to lay down their hand by bluffing.</p>
</div></div></div><div class="nano stage__step js-step"><div class="nano-content"><h3 class="step__title">The Hand</h3><div itemprop="articleBody" class="modal__description--text"><p>The hand is a player&#39;s best five-card combination.

<p>Firstly, a player indicated by ‘the dealer’ marker (‘D&#39;) is the designated dealer for the current game.</p>
<p>Secondly, two compulsory bets are taken. The player to the left of the dealer button posts the first forced bet, called ‘the small blind’. The player to the left of the small blind posts the second mandatory bet called ‘the big blind’. The big blind is twice the amount of the small blind.</p>
<p>Finally, each player is dealt four face-down hole cards.</p>

The position is also known as the ‘dealer button’ or simply the ‘button’ and is indicated with a ‘D’ marker. The dealer position is important because it determines the order in which the players act.</p>
<p>The dealer is regarded as the best table position. The player in the dealer position can observe the actions of their opponents before their turn comes around. It allows players to analyse their opponents and make decisions based on their opponents&#39; actions.</p>
<p>The dealer changes position after each hand, and the button rotates clockwise around the table. After the first betting round is over, the player to the left of the current dealer button becomes the dealer for the next round.</p>

The amount of the big blind is the minimum bet in the current game round. The small and big blinds are important because they incite the action and get the game going, with money already in the pot to win. </p>

If all players decide to check in the current betting round, meaning there are no new bets, the amount in the pot remains the same as after the turn betting round. If all players, except one, decide to fold in the current round, the player who has not folded wins the pot, and the betting round ends.</p>

However, it is very important to remember that a player can only – and must only - use any two of their four hole cards and any three of the five community cards to form a hand.</p>
</div></div></div><div class="nano stage__step js-step"><div class="nano-content"><h3 class="step__title">Tip 2</h3><div class="modal__description--text"><p>Unlike Hold&#39;em, Omaha Hi is a game of big draws. With four starting cards, the average winning had in PLO is much stronger, as well. Therefore, you should be very picky when choosing to play a hand. When drawing, look for connected hands like A♥K♣J♣10♥ that can make nut-straights and flushes.</p>
