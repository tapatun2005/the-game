class="step__text"><p>If you are new to poker, Texas Hold’em is the best way to start learning this awesome game. For a reason it is considered the most simple poker game and often just a few minutes are enough to understand the rules before start your first playing round. However, do not let its simplicity mislead you. The game can be rather complex when played at a higher level offering a large number of possible game situations.</p>
<p>According to the legend, Texas Hold’em is known to have originated from Robstown in state Texas in early 1900s. It was first played in Las Vegas in 1967. Now Texas Hold’em is played in all international poker tournaments and it is the most popular poker game around the world.</p>
</div></div><div data-step="" class="stage__step js-step"><h3 class="step__title">Quick Start</h3><div class="step__text"><p>Texas Holdem is played by two to ten (?) players using set of 52 cards with no jokers. Each player is dealt two face down cards, also known as “hole cards”. Five community cards are dealt face up in three rounds on the poker table. The money pot is formed by players in four betting rounds: pre-flop, flop, turn and river.</p>
</div></div><div data-step="" class="stage__step js-step"><h3 class="step__title">Aim</h3><div class="step__text"><p>The aim for the player to win the money from the pot by forming the best possible five cards combination, known as the hand, using two hole and five community cards or convince other players to lay down their hand by bluffing.</p>
</div></div><div data-step="" class="stage__step js-step"><h3 class="step__title">The Hand</h3><div class="step__text"><p>The player can use both, one or none of their hole cards to form the best hand combination. If the player does not use any of his hole cards at all it is called ‘playing the board’. This means that the five community cards on the table is the best possible combination for this player.</p>
</div></div></div><div class="stage__navigation"><span class="btn stage__nav__item nav-prev js-prev-intro"><</span><span class="btn stage__nav__item nav-next js-next-intro">></span></div></div></section><section data-section="" class="game__section section__rules js-section js-section-rules"><h2 class="stage__title">Deal  <span class="stage__subtitle">Stage</span></h2><div class="stage__steps"><div data-step="" class="stage__step js-step"><h3 class="step__title">Dealer</h3><div class="step__text"><p>Dealer is a table position of the player who acts last in all betting rounds except from the pre-flop. It is also known as ‘dealer button’ or simply ‘button’ and is indicated with a ‘D’ marker. The dealer position is important because it determines the order in which the players bet.</p>
<p>The dealer is known to be the best table position. This is because the player in the dealer position can observe the actions of his opponents before his turn comes. It allows the player to analyse his opponents and make a decision based on their actions.</p>
<p>No need to worry if you are not chosen as the dealer at the beginning of a game. Dealer is a changing position which rotates clockwise around the table for each game round. When the first game round is over, the player to the left of the current dealer button becomes the dealer for the next game round.</p>
</div></div><div data-step="" class="stage__step js-step"><h3 class="step__title">Small Blind</h3><div class="step__text"><p>Small Blind, marked as SB, is the first of the two compulsory bets. It is placed by the player immediately to the left of the dealer.</p>
</div></div><div data-step="" class="stage__step js-step"><h3 class="step__title">Big Blind</h3><div class="step__text"><p>Big blind, marked as BB, is the second of the two compulsory bets. It is placed by the player immediately to the left of the small blind. Big blind is twice the amount of the small blind. The amount of the big blind becomes the minimum bet in the current game round.</p>
</div></div><div data-step="" class="stage__step js-step"><h3 class="step__title">Hole cards</h3><div class="step__text"><p>When the small and big blinds are placed, each player gets two face down cards. Those are the players’ private cards, also known as hole cards.</p>

The position of the player who acts first in the pre-flop round is known as ‘under the gun’. It is considered to be the weakest table position, because ‘under the gun’ player has to make decisions with no prior information about his opponents play.</p>
</div></div><div data-step="" class="stage__step js-step"><h3 class="step__title">Call</h3><div class="step__text"><p>To call is to match the bet made by the previous player. The first bet after the big blind needs to match the big blind or raise it.</p>
</div></div><div data-step="" class="stage__step js-step"><h3 class="step__title">Raise</h3><div class="step__text"><p>To raise is to increase the bet amount made by the previous player. If a player raised the current bet, all the subsequent bets have to equal or be higher than his bet.</p>
</div></div><div data-step="" class="stage__step js-step"><h3 class="step__title">Fold</h3><div class="step__text"><p>To fold is to not play the hand. If you decide to fold you are no longer eligible to take part in anymore betting until a new game round starts.</p>
</div></div><div data-step="" class="stage__step js-step"><h3 class="step__title">Check</h3><div class="step__text"><p>To check means to bet nothing. In the pre-flop round only the big blind has an option to check if no one raised the big blind. If someone raised, the big blind can either call, raise or fold.</p>

</div></div><div data-step="" class="stage__step js-step"><h3 class="step__title">All-in</h3><div class="step__text"><p>If a player wants to continue playing but does not have enough money to call the current bet,
his option is to put all his money in a pot. This is called an ‘all-in’ bet. </p>
<p>The limitation of this option is that if the player with an “all-in” bet wins the game, he can not claim all the money in the pot. He should return the money that were put in the pot by other player above his bet.</p>
<p>For example, one player bets $10, the second player has only $2. The second player puts all-in. The total pot is now $12. The second player wins the game. He must return $8 to the first player. This means that the second player can only take the amount of his own bet from the first player, which is equal $2. So in this example, the second person won $4. </p>
