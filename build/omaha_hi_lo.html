In this version of Omaha, the money pot is split 50/50 between the highest hand (five-card combination) and the lowest hand. If one player has both the best Hi and Lo hands, they get to scoop 100% of the pot! </p>
<p>The history of Omaha Hi-Lo goes back to the start of the Second World War when community card games first became popular. It was first played in Las Vegas in 1982. However, it wasn&#39;t until 1991 that the game was added to the World Series of Poker (WSOP). Recently, Omaha Hi-Lo has been gaining ground in the poker world, both offline and online.</p>
</div></div></div><div class="nano stage__step js-step"><div class="nano-content"><h3 class="step__title">Quick Start</h3><div itemprop="articleBody" class="modal__description--text"><p>Omaha Hi-Lo is played by two to ten people using a deck of 52 cards with no jokers. Each player is dealt four face-down cards at the beginning of the game, also known as hole cards. Five community cards are dealt face up over three rounds at the poker table. The rounds are called the “flop”, “turn” and “river”. The money in the pot (chips) is built by the players over the following four betting rounds: pre-flop, flop, turn and river.</p>
</div></div></div><div class="nano stage__step js-step"><div class="nano-content"><h3 class="step__title">Aim</h3><div itemprop="articleBody" class="modal__description--text"><p>The goal is to win the money/chips in the pot by forming a better high and/or low five-card combination (hand) than the rest of the players, or by convincing other players to lay down their hand by bluffing. In this form of poker, there can be two winners, in which case the money pot is split between them, equally. If one player has the best Hi and Lo hands, the win all the money in the pot.</p>
</div></div></div><div class="nano stage__step js-step"><div class="nano-content"><h3 class="step__title">The Hand</h3><div itemprop="articleBody" class="modal__description--text"><p>The hand is a player&#39;s best five-card combination. In Omaha Hi-Lo, a hand must be made up of any two of a player’s four hole cards in combination with any three of the five community cards. But remember, even though you have four hole cards, you must only use two to form a hand – not one, not three, not four.</p>

<p>Firstly, a player indicated by ‘the dealer’ marker (‘D&#39;) is the designated dealer for the current game.</p>
<p>Secondly, two compulsory bets are taken. The player to the left of the dealer button posts the first forced bet, called ‘the small blind’. The player to the left of the small blind posts the second mandatory bet called ‘the big blind’. The big blind is twice the amount of the small blind.</p>
<p>Finally, each player is dealt four face-down hole cards.</p>

The position is also known as the ‘dealer button’ or simply the ‘button’ and is indicated with a ‘D’ marker. The dealer position is important because it determines the order in which the players act.</p>
<p>The dealer is regarded as the best table position. The player in the dealer position can observe the actions of their opponents before their turn comes around. It allows players to analyse their opponents and make decisions based on their opponents&#39; actions.</p>
<p>The dealer changes position after each hand, and the button rotates clockwise around the table. After the first betting round is over, the player to the left of the current dealer button becomes the dealer for the next round.</p>

In Limit games, the small blind equals one-half of the selected table’s lower betting limit, i.e. if a table’s lower betting limit is $2 in a $2/$4 game, the small blind would be $1. In Pot Limit Omaha Hi-Lo games, the small blind equals the selected table’s lower betting limit, i.e. if a table’s lower betting limit is $2 in a $2/$4, the small blind would be $2.</p>

In Pot Limit Omaha Hi-Lo games, the big blind equals the selected table’s higher betting limit, i.e. if a table’s higher betting limit is $4 in a $2/$4 game, the big blind would be $4. The amount of the big blind is the minimum bet in the current game round. The small and big blinds are important because they incite the action and get the game going, with money already in the pot to win. </p>

Usually, if a player wants to continue in a hand but does not have enough money to call the current bet, they can go an all-in for whatever amount they have left in their stack. </p>
<p>However, if the all-in player wins the hand, they can only lay claim to the total amount of their stack. In other words, if they go all-in for $25, and their two opponents have $100 each, they can only win $25 from each player, for a total of $75 (including their $25 all-in). </p>

If all players decide to check in the current betting round, meaning there are no new bets, the amount in the pot remains the same as after the flop betting round. If all players, except one, decide to fold in the current round, the player who has not folded wins the pot, and the betting round ends. </p>

At this stage, each of the remaining players must use any two of their four hole cards plus any three of the five community cards to form both/either the best high and/or the best low hand. The best low hand gets half the pot, and the best high hand gets the other half. If there is no qualifying low hand, the player with the best high hand wins all the money chips in the pot. </p>

<p>For example, here are two low hands: </p>
<p>a) 8 - 4 - 3 - 2 - A and b) 7 - 6 - 5 - 4 - 3</p>
<p>Example ‘b’ is a better low hand – even without an ace, because the highest card in that hand is a 7. Whereas in example ‘a’, the highest low-card is an 8. </p>
<p>If the highest low-cards in all low combinations are the same, the next highest card down will be the tiebreaker. For example, 8 - 4 - 3 - 2 - A and 8 - 5 - 3 - 2 – A. The first low hand wins, because the second low card is a 4, which is lower than the 5 in the second example. </p>
<p>It is also possible for two or more players to have identical low hands. For example, 8-7-6-5-4 and 8-7-6-5-4. In this case, the 50% of the pot allocated to the best low hand would be split between those two players. They would each receive 25% of the pot.</p>

However, it is very important to remember that a player must use any two – but only two - of their four hole cards along with any three of the community cards to form a hand.</p>
