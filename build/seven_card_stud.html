Seven Card Stud is the classic poker game and was played well before community-cards games became more popular. It is a highly challenging game, requiring more attention and strategic moves from players.   </p>
<p>Stud is believed to have originated in the Midwest of the United States. This variation of poker was very popular among soldiers during the  America Civil War from 1861-1865, and was played with 5 cards to each player. The game turned into Seven Card Stud at the beginning of 20th century and remained the most popular poker game until 1980’s. It has become popular worldwide, due to its intricate game play, which gives it a true poker feel. </p>
<p>Seven Card Stud is normally a fixed-limit poker game, meaning that the players can only bet a limited amount of money within a game round.</p>
</div></div></div><div class="nano stage__step js-step"><div class="nano-content"><h3 class="step__title">Quick Start</h3><div itemprop="articleBody" class="modal__description--text"><p>Seven Card Stud is a variation of poker played with between two to eight players using a deck of 52 cards with no jokers. One game round consists of five betting rounds. Initially, each player has to place an opening bet to start the pot off, also known as an ante. After the initial bets are taken, each player is dealt two individual face-down cards (hole cards) and one face-up card (door card). </p>
<p>The player with the worst door card is assigned as the bring-in (a forced bet that is akin to a blind in Hold&#39;em). The amount is usually 30-50% of the lower stake, and the 2 of clubs is the worst card in the deck when assessing the bring-in. Players who remain active throughout an entire game round will receive a total of three face-down cards and four face-up cards. No community cards are dealt on the table. The winner is a player who can form the best five-card combination (poker hand).</p>
</div></div></div><div class="nano stage__step js-step"><div class="nano-content"><h3 class="step__title">Betting limits</h3><div itemprop="articleBody" class="modal__description--text"><p>The betting amount is determined by the specific table’s lower and higher betting limits (stakes). There are different betting limits at different tables so players can choose a table with the amount that they are willing to wager. A table&#39;s lower betting limit is always half of the higher betting limit, e.g. a $1/$2 table or a $5/$10 table. </p>
</div></div></div><div class="nano stage__step js-step"><div class="nano-content"><h3 class="step__title">Aim</h3><div itemprop="articleBody" class="modal__description--text"><p>The goal is to win the money/chips in the pot by forming a better high and/or low five-card combination (hand) than the rest of the players, or by convincing other players to lay down their hand by bluffing. A hand is made up of any five out of a player’s seven-card board.</p>

<p>Once all the players are gathered around a specific table with the relevant amount of chips, there are a few steps to be taken before the game commences.</p>
<p>Firstly, all players have to place a forced bet (ante) to start off the initial pot. Secondly, all players are dealt two face-down cards and one face-up card. Once the bring-in has been assessed, players then act one at a time clockwise around the table.</p>

<p>The player with the worst door card is assigned as the bring-in (a forced bet that is akin to a blind in Hold&#39;em). The 2 of clubs is the worst card in the deck when assessing the bring-in. This is the only instance in the game where the suits come into play. The bring-in amount is usually 30-50% of the lower stake This player has two options: post the bring-in amount or ‘complete’ the bet by upping it to the lower table limit.
