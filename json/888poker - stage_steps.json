    "description": "The Dealer is a table position assigned to the player who acts last in all betting rounds except pre-flop – as long as they choose to play the hand. It is also known as the ‘dealer button’ or simply the ‘button’ and is indicated by a ‘D’ marker. The dealer position is important because it determines the order in which players can act.\n\nThe dealer is known to be the best table position. The player in the dealer position can observe the actions of their opponents before it's their turn to act. It allows the player to analyse their opponents and make decisions based on their previous actions.\n\nNo need to worry if you are not chosen as the dealer at the beginning of a game. The dealer button rotates clockwise one position around the table after each hand. At the end of a hand, the player to the left of the current dealer button becomes the dealer for the next round."
