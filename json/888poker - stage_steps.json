    "description": "Dealer is a table position of the player who acts last in all betting rounds except from the pre-flop. It is also known as ‘dealer button’ or simply ‘button’ and is indicated with a ‘D’ marker. The dealer position is important because it determines the order in which the players bet.\n\nThe dealer is known to be the best table position. This is because the player in the dealer position can observe the actions of his opponents before his turn comes. It allows the player to analyse his opponents and make a decision based on their actions.\n\nNo need to worry if you are not chosen as the dealer at the beginning of a game. Dealer is a changing position which rotates clockwise around the table for each game round. When the first game round is over, the player to the left of the current dealer button becomes the dealer for the next game round.\n"

The total pot is now $12. The second player wins the game. He must return $8 to the first player. This means that the second player can only take the amount of his own bet from the first player, which is equal $2. So in this example, the second person won $4. "
