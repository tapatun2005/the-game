    "description": "A player's position at a poker table is very important in Texas Hold’em. Before playing a hand, always be aware of your table position in relation to the dealer button. The closer you are to the button, the more information you can learn about your opponent’s play. You will also have fewer players left to act after you."

    "description": "There are 169 possible starting hands in Texas Hold’em. Out of those only five are regarded as premium hands combinations: A-A, K-K, Q-Q, A-K suited and J-J. So, one of the smartest poker tips is to fold more hands than you play."

    "description": "Unlike Hold'em, Omaha Hi is a game of big draws. With four starting cards, the average winning had in PLO is much stronger, as well. Therefore, you should be very picky when choosing to play a hand. When drawing, look for connected hands like A♥K♣J♣10♥ that can make nut-straights and flushes."

    "description": "It is important to remember that the low hand always counts downwards from the highest card first. \n\nFor example, here are two low hands: \n\na) 8 - 4 - 3 - 2 - A and b) 7 - 6 - 5 - 4 - 3\n\nExample ‘b’ is a better low hand – even without an ace, because the highest card in that hand is a 7. Whereas in example ‘a’, the highest low-card is an 8. \n\nIf the highest low-cards in all low combinations are the same, the next highest card down will be the tiebreaker. For example, 8 - 4 - 3 - 2 - A and 8 - 5 - 3 - 2 – A. The first low hand wins, because the second low card is a 4, which is lower than the 5 in the second example. \n\nIt is also possible for two or more players to have identical low hands. For example, 8-7-6-5-4 and 8-7-6-5-4. In this case, the 50% of the pot allocated to the best low hand would be split between those two players. They would each receive 25% of the pot."
