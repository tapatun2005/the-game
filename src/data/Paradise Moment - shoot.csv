Lighting,"You can make the most of different lighting conditions by adjusting the picture style to match the subject. If you’re shooting landscape, look for the “vivid” or “landscape” mode to give you rich saturated colors. If you’re shooting people, you don’t want supersaturated skin tones, so move to the “portrait” or “neutral” setting for best results."
Lighting,"Point and shoot cameras are designed with very small imaging sensors, which are great when there is a lot of light around. In low light, however, you have to set the ISO sensitivity higher and that can cause the image to be degraded with digital grain called “noise.” If you find yourself in low light conditions, try leaving the ISO at 400 or less, but, use a small table top tripod to keep the camera steady. There are countless tiny pocket tripods on the market  that tuck away in pocket or purse, and  will allow you to shoot long shutter speeds in low light and get terrific results."
Lighting,"Sometimes, the relative brightness of your subject can “fool” your camera’s light meter. If your point and shoot pictures look consistently washed out, try setting the exposure compensation (the little button with the +/- sign) to -1. Likewise, if your shots look too dark, use the same control, but set it to +1."
Exposure,Compare to DSLR with RAW they provide you with JPG only and much less flexibility of settings what makes the shooting situation more demanding.
Exposure,Try exploring auto modes; sport mode is particularly good as it provides faster shutter speed than standard settings therefore moving objects will not be blurred. The night mode will set the camera for long exposure without flash but do consider a tripod because the results may surprise you.
Exposure,How often you see people flashing while taking a sunset photo? Switch the flash off and manually set the ISO to minimum and sit the camera on something stable to have a long exposure with ambient light.
Exposure,Make use of the live view option. What you see on the LCD display is often closely duplicated in the final effect (this actually also applies very well to DSLR/MSRL cameras).
Techs,"Your camera might be point-and-shoot, but that doesn't mean you're limited to Auto mode. Play around with settings like aperture, shutter speed and ISO on your point-and-shoot, whether to prepare you for an upgrade to a DSLR, or simply to gain more technical control over your photos."
Techs,"Use your flash, but use it wisely. For example, since most point-and-shoots don't shoot in raw, you won't be able lift unnecessary shadows, so consider using your flash to balance out bright daylight that shadows facial features and other important details."
Techs,"Point-and-shoots can't do everything DSLRs can do, but they can do many things that are prohibitively expensive with DSLRs. For example, it's more cost-effective to purchase a waterproof point-and-shoot for underwater photography, rather than an expensive (and not accident proof!) DSLR housing—and the effect on photo quality will be minimal."
Composition,"When you’re shooting a large-scale scene it can be hard to know how big your subject should be in the frame, and how much you should zoom in by. To avoid these problems you should zoom in to fill the frame, which flattens the perspective of the shot and makes it easier to control or exclude what’s shown in the background."
Composition,"It’s easy to get stuck in a rut and take every picture with the camera held horizontally. Try turning it to get a vertical shot instead, adjusting your position or the zoom setting as you experiment with the new style. You can often improve on both horizontal and vertical shots by cropping the photo later or even try cropping to a 16:9 ratio for a widescreen effect, or to the square shape used by medium-format cameras."
Composition,"When setting up an image, it’s important to take advantage of the lines in the frame to guide viewers’ eyes to the subject of the photo.  Lines exist everywhere, in the form of walls, fences, roads, buildings and telephone wires. Converging lines give a strong sense of perspective and three-dimensional depth, drawing you into an image. Horizontal lines lend a static, calm feel to a picture, while vertical ones often suggest permanence and stability. To introduce a feeling of drama, movement or uncertainty, look for diagonal lines instead."
Composition,"When setting up your scene, move your subject away from the centre and get a feel for how it can be balanced with everything else in the scene, including any areas of contrasting color or light. There are no hard and fast rules about achieving visual balance, but you’ll quickly learn to rely on your instincts, trust that you’ll know when something just looks right!"
Composition,"Don’t just concentrate on your subject; look at what’s happening in the background, too. You’ll often find that changing your position is enough to replace a cluttered background with one that complements your subject nicely."
Composition,"Because white balance is all processed in-camera, you’ll want to get the color right for JPEG files at the time of shooting. You can use your camera’s preset options (Daylight, Shade, Tungsten, etc) instead of relying on the auto option to get it right."
Filters,"Many point-and-shoot manufacturers make an adapter that allows larger, standard-size filters to mount in front of the lens."
Filters,"Just like with phone cameras, if you don’t have a filter that fits your point-and-shoot, you can hand-hold a larger filter in front of the lens and achieve the exact same result. But be sure to hold the filter in contact with the lens, less light leak in and ruin your shot."
Filters,"Another solution to the size problem with a smaller lens is to use magnetic attachments for filters, which allow you to easily attach them to, and detach them from, the front of a lens."
Filters,In-camera filters are only digital alterations applied to the data. Physical filters are always a superior alternative.
Timing,"Shoot little video clips, framing a moment from its start to its conclusion. You can do this on any type of camera, but it’s especially great on a point-and-shoot where you don’t have a lot of options to experiment with exposure times. "
Timing,Hold the camera steady while deliberately framing and/or moving your shot to follow the action. This is one of the most important technical skills to learn about timing.
Timing,"Then look back at the clip and ask yourself, “What was the moment of impact? When did the emotion of the video take a turn?” Learn to identify and feel this moment. You can then apply the skill of waiting for the same sensation to help you time when to press the shutter on a still shot."
Timing,"One word of caution: some point-and-shoot camera have a significant lag between when you press the button and when it records the image. If you find yourself frustrated because the camera is missing your precise moments of interest, you might want to upgrade."
