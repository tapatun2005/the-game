Lighting,"Don’t forget to use the lens hood that comes with most DSLR lenses. Not only will it prevent stray light from entering the lens and marring your photograph with flare, it is also great protection from minor bumps that might otherwise ding the lens itself."
Lighting,"In most cases the “multi-segmented” mode for your camera’s light meter will give you consistently good results. However, in some circumstances, like photographing  a performer in a spotlight or other situations where there is a sharp dropoff from very bright to very dark values, the center-weighted or spot meter option is a better choice for accurate exposure."
Lighting,"Shooting landscapes in the early morning or late afternoon not only takes advantage of the long, sculpting shadows that are present at those times of day, but also of the warmer tones that are prevalent as the sun hangs near the horizon."
Exposure,Keep it as low as possible or native level to reduce the noise. For most cameras use ISO 100 or 200 this combined with average daylight and reasonable aperture results in a good shutter speed.
Exposure,"As it starts to get darker, you may struggle. Set your ISO to Auto Mode and set your camera to minimum shutter speed (e.g. 1/125) and push the Auto ISO according to aperture settings."
Exposure,"The high contrast situations requires special attention, it is recommended to work with RAW files. They give you a chance to correct exposure if not done properly. You can make life easier by using the bracketing to capture the range of exposures."
Exposure,When working with RAWs it is easier to recover details from the over exposed parts than from underexposed. If you shoot the high contrast situation try to set the exposure towards the darker areas.
Techs,"Get your camera out right now and switch it to shoot in RAW mode. Even if you only edit your photos minimally, the effectiveness of your edits is exponentially larger (and their diminishment to photo quality exponentially smaller) when you shoot in RAW."
Techs,"Buy a tripod and wireless remote. Whether you take advantage of the tripod's stabilizing effects for long-exposure night shots, or use the remote to snap selfies that don't look like selfies, these are two of the best investments you can make in both the technical and artistic quality of your photography. (Fun fact: Every photo of me you see on my website, as well as the headshot attached to this post, is a selfie!)"
Techs,"Turn your camera off when changing lenses to avoid getting dust in the sensor. If you don't, the mirror stays locked up, which exposes your sensor directly to the elements. Cleaning your sensor is generally not covered by warranty and can cost you hundreds of dollars."
Techs,"As a general rule, f/8 is a good aperture setting for night shots. If you shoot with a larger aperture, the shallower depth of field can result in unintentional blurring, while smaller apertures can result in shots that are too dark."
Techs,"Always shoot at the lowest possible ISO. The higher the ISO, the more noise your photos will have, even on extremely high quality, full-frame DSLRs."
Composition,"To isolate your subject from the background my making the background out of focus, use a wide aperture and to include the background by keeping it in focus, use a smaller one. In a landscape, you typically want everything to remain in focus. In a portrait, you may want that background to be out of focus."
Composition,"You should shoot with the horizon as close to horizontal as possible. If your digital camera’s got an in-camera level, use it. If not, a number of DSLRs have a grid that can be activated and superimposed over a Live View image on the rear LCD screen, making getting level horizons much simpler."
Composition,"Wide-angle lenses can give the impression of increased distance between near and distant elements, while telephoto focal lengths appear to compress perspective. Consider this when you’re framing a shot and position yourself to use the focal length that’s best for the image, rather than simply choosing a focal length that fits everything in."
Composition,"It’s all too easy to become over-reliant on your camera’s autofocus, and there are some situations where focusing manually is definitely a better option, for example, pre-focusing to photograph a fast-moving subject on a race track, or focusing precisely for a detailed macro shot."
Composition,"Digital SLR cameras may have a large number of auto focus points to choose from, but for the majority of shots you only need a single auto focus point, the central one. Place this over your subject, half-press the shutter release to lock the focus, and then simply recompose the shot."
Filters,"Circular polarizing filters work much better with modern auto-focus technology than linear polarizing filters do. The latter are less expensive, but are a prudent purchase only if you often focus manually."
Filters,"Try to invest in a set of lenses that all take the same filter size. That way you don’t need to buy, store and carry multiple sizes of the same filter."
Filters,"When using split neutral density, bypass circular filters in favor of rectangular filters that slide into a holder attached to the lens. Being able to move the filter up and down and left and right will afford much more flexibility when framing a composition."
Filters,"Consider getting a 10-stop neutral density filter—or a “black filter”—which diminishes light by a factor of 1,000. A 1/30 exposure becomes 30 seconds! Use it to blur water motion or clouds even in bright sunlight."
Timing,"As an experiment, shoot longer exposures. Set the shutter to 1/30 or 1/15 of a second. Track a moving subject with your camera, or move the camera slightly side to side or up and down, to create an image that captures the blur of the passage of time."
Timing,"Now go back to using a fast shutter speed by finding something to shoot in bright light, set your manual camera to 1/250 of second or faster. Wait for that split second when your image holds the feeling for you that you learned with longer exposures. See if you can instill the same ethereal sense in a sharper image."
Timing,"Your sense of timing is your signature on your images, and it’s something to take deliberate control over. Like framing a shot for video, you must hold the camera steady and wait for the emotional turn. Learn to anticipate it, and let the feeling that swells in you be what triggers the shutter."
