Lighting,"When shooting selfies, open shade or soft overcast will be more flattering than harsh direct sunlight."
Lighting,"The most popular travel shots taken with cellphones are pictures of family and friends in front of monuments or views.  For best results, make sure that the lighting conditions are the same in the foreground and background. Too often, the people near the camera are in shade and the view is in sunlight, which means you’ll get nothing but silhouettes."
Lighting,"If you want to shoot in low light, be sure your elbows are braced, or even better, that your device is resting on a table or even on top of a backpack or handbag. Because it is dark, the shutter will have to stay open for a relatively long time, and unless the phone is held rock steady, you’ll get shaky shots."
Exposure,When shooting panoramas remember that the camera blocks the exposure at the first frame and keeps it to the end. Starting from the very bright part you will end up with underexposed dark parts of panorama and vice versa. 
Exposure,Ensure the white balance is correct or use it as a creative tool and push the temperature on purpose - it can have an interesting visual effect.
Exposure,"Check if your phone camera has HDR option, if not you can download an App. The HDR option is very useful in high contrast situation; within a few seconds you can get nice effects that normally would require computer software."
Exposure,Check if your camera has a RAW option! If yes than you can explore the tips and advanced post processing reserved mostly for DSLR/MSLR users.
Techs,"Many mobile phones can accommodate snap-on lenses, from wide-angle, to fisheye, to macro, to zoom. Take advantage of mobile phone lens kits to adjust the scope your mobile photography."
Techs,"Use third-party apps such as Adobe PS Mobile and Snapseed for editing, rather than your phone's built-in editor. In addition to the fact that these apps have more (and better!) features, they edit copies of your photos, leaving the originals intact in case you change your mind."
Techs,"On the other hand, you shouldn't predicate your mobile photography outcomes on editing later on, regardless of which tool you use. Focus on taking a photo that is fundamentally good in terms of its exposure, lighting and composition, then worry about adding bells and whistles."
Composition,"The human eye tends to be more interested in images that are divided into thirds, with the subject falling at or along one of those divisions. Use your eye to roughly divide your image with four lines into nine equal-sized parts, and then place your subject at the intersection of those lines. For example, when photographing a subject it is generally better to position it at the right or left third of the frame rather than directly in the middle. This is referred to the rule of thirds."
Composition,"Viewers tend to be more comfortable with images that contain an odd number of elements, rather than an even number. The human eye will naturally wander towards the center of a group and if there's empty space there, then that's where the eye will fall. As a photographer, you want your viewer to look at a subject, not at an empty space."
Composition,"When you look at a scene with your naked eye, your brain quickly focuses on subjects of interest; but the camera captures everything in front of it.  This can lead to a cluttered, messy picture with no clear focus.  To avoid this you can make your subject the centre of attention in the frame. You can’t always keep other objects out of the picture, so try to keep them out of focus in the background or make them part of the visual story."
Composition,"Viewpoint can dramatically change the mood of a photograph, for example, a photo of a child shot from above, makes the child appear small, or less than equal to the viewer. Shot from the child’s eye level, the viewer is more easily able to see things from their point of view. In this case the viewer becomes an equal rather than a superior. But shoot that same child from below and suddenly there's a sense of dominance about the child. Viewpoint isn't just limited to high, low and eye-level; you can also radically change the perception of an object by shooting it from a distance or from close up."
Composition,"Perspective can change the viewer's perception of an object's size. For example, to emphasize the height of a tree, shoot it from below, looking up; or, to make something seem smaller, shoot it from above, looking down. Try to use perspective in a way that the viewer can understand your photograph’s visual message."
Composition,"Bright primary colors attract the viewer’s eye, especially when they’re contrasted with a complementary color. But there are other ways of creating color contrasts, such as including a bright splash of color against a monochromatic background. Though, you can take a striking photograph using contrasting colors, you don’t need strong color contrasts to create striking pictures, scenes consisting almost entirely of a single hue can be very effective. The key is to be really selective about how you isolate and frame your subjects to exclude unwanted colors."
Filters,"Some manufacturers do make universal clip-on filters for a camera phone that can create fun image transformations, such as starbursts or kaleidoscopes. You can even get a small polarizer!"
Filters,"If you don’t have a tiny polarizing filter for your camera phone, you can still achieve the effect by holding polarized sunglasses in front of the lens."
Filters,"Moreover, if you have any camera filter, whether square or screw-in, you can hold that in front of your phone lens to accomplish the same goal."
Filters,Many free and premium apps specialize in replicating filter effects digitally after capture.
Timing,"Download an app that overrides your smartphones exposure length, like Slow Shutter. Shooting images with intentional blur is a fun way to portray the passage of time in a shot. Use it at night for trails of moving car lights or in subway stations for cool shots of moving people and trains."
Timing,"Most of the newest versions of smartphones have a pretty fast reaction time on when you press the button, but it still won’t be as quick or instantaneously as a high-end DSLR. Track any action in your shot and take several shots quickly to make sure you get all of the elements to fall into place."
Timing,"Patience is a virtue. On a mobile device you have a good-sized screen to preview your composition, so take your time and check all the corners of the frame. If someone or something (an idling truck, a floating plastic bag, etc.) is passing through your shot, either wait for it to move, or recompose the shot to cover it or use it deliberately in the shot. If you have to wait 5 minutes for the delivery truck to move, at least you can check your messages in the meantime. Wait for the shot you want."
