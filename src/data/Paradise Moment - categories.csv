Lighting,"Experiment with what time of day you choose to take a picture. The difference in natural light and weather can completely change the scene you are capturing. Sunrise, midday and twilight create three totally different types of ambient lighting and therefore imagery. Look at the time of day as a ‘tool’ for your photo, each tool will differ depending on what image you are trying to communicate.",The best kind of light for photography is the type of light that gives shape to a picture and makes scenes look interesting with different tones of depth.,"Usually, shooting indoors with artificial light will give you a flat picture with white or yellow undertones. You'll know flat light when you see it; there is no depth and everything looks consistently lit. Strong light creates strong shadows and because of this it is sometimes best to shoot outside on a cloudier day, where the clouds can diffuse the light, but still capture the rich colours brought out by vibrant sunlight.

Exposure,"Exposing the sensor to capture the picture seems to be trivial in the era of digital imaging. Somehow this act has lost its importance compared to the era of film, you can correct your mistakes quickly.",Keep in mind however that none of situation happens twice.,"So be conscious of your actions, keep control and speed to take the best out of your camera and situation to reproduce your feelings.",icon_exposure.svg,icon_orange_exposure.svg,icon_blue_exposure.svg,main_exposure.svg,mobile_exposure.svg,camera_exposure.svg,shoot_exposure.svg

Composition,"In photography, the placement or arrangement of visual elements in an image is referred to as composition.  It’s important to remember that it’s not just what you shoot that counts, but the way that you shoot it is crucial. ","Poor composition can make an interesting subject appear dull, but a well-shot scene can create a wonderful photograph from the most ordinary objects.","A poorly composed photograph will leave your viewers unsure about where to look, and their attention might drift aimlessly around the scene without finding a clear focus, but if you follow these guidelines you’ll be taking interesting photos in no time!  Though most composition tips can be used with any type of camera, there are sometimes more options when using a SLR camera. Composition doesn’t have to be complicated; if you pay too much attention to strict formula, your photos will lose any kind of spontaneity.  In the real world, you’ll be working with a wide range of subjects and scenes, which requires an open-minded approach. The rules of photography aren't meant to stifle your creativity, they are meant to provide you with guidelines for enhancing it.",icon_composition.svg,icon_orange_composition.svg,icon_blue_composition.svg,main_composition.svg,mobile_composition.svg,camera_composition.svg,shoot_composition.svg
Filters,"Filters are commonly thought of as obsolete tools of the pre-digital era, and for many filters, that is certainly true. ",But two filters are still enormously useful for creating great photography: the polarizer and the neutral-density.,"A polarizing filter will improve almost any landscape photo, either in nature or in the city. It will remove reflections from surfaces, make many bright scenes appear less contrasty, and boost the color of foliage and the sky. Neutral density filters help you achieve longer exposures in brighter light. This helps achieve creative effects such as blurring the motion of a waterfall, or using a larger aperture in excessively sunny conditions. And a split neutral density filter—wherein half the filter is shaded and the rest clear glass—helps balance the exposure of a scene that has uneven luminance.",icon_filters.svg,icon_orange_filters.svg,icon_blue_filters.svg,main_filters.svg,mobile_filters.svg,camera_filters.svg,shoot_filters.svg
Timing,"Timing is crucial to the impact of my photos, and I learned a lot studying film. For a movie, you have to give the subject room to enter and clear the frame - in other words, there needs to be space for the emotion of the moment to unfold.","By training yourself to look for the “swell” of a moment, you can translate the anticipation, crest, and conclusion into a single frame as a still photographer, too.","Create awareness of time in your mind with these experiments, and it will begin to naturally lend all of your images a more deliberate use of timing.",icon_timing.svg,icon_orange_timing.svg,icon_blue_timing.svg,main_timing.svg,mobile_timing.svg,camera_timing.svg,shoot_timing.svg
