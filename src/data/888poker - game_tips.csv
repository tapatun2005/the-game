Texas Holdem,Tip 1,texas_holdem_tip_1,"A player's position at a poker table is very important in Texas Hold’em. Before playing a hand, always be aware of your table position in relation to the dealer button. The closer you are to the button, the more information you can learn about your opponent’s play. You will also have fewer players left to act after you."
Texas Holdem,Tip 2,texas_holdem_tip_2,"There are 169 possible starting hands in Texas Hold’em. Out of those only five are regarded as premium hands combinations: A-A, K-K, Q-Q, A-K suited and J-J. So, one of the smartest poker tips is to fold more hands than you play."
Texas Holdem,Tip 3,texas_holdem_tip_3,"It is vital that you keep your concentration levels high at the poker table to achieve better results. If you lose control and allow your emotions influence your decisions, you are no longer playing effectively. Losing control of your emotions is known as ‘tilting’ in poker."
Omaha HI,Tip 1,omaha_hi_tip_1,"If you are already familiar with Texas Hold'em rules, Omaha can seem very similar. However, it is very important to remember that a player can only – and must only - use any two of their four hole cards and any three of the five community cards to form a hand."
Omaha HI,Tip 2,omaha_hi_tip_2,"Unlike Hold'em, Omaha Hi is a game of big draws. With four starting cards, the average winning had in PLO is much stronger, as well. Therefore, you should be very picky when choosing to play a hand. When drawing, look for connected hands like A♥K♣J♣10♥ that can make nut-straights and flushes."
Omaha HI/LO,Tip 1,omaha_hi_lo_tip_1,"It is important to remember that the low hand always counts downwards from the highest card first. 

For example, here are two low hands: 

a) 8 - 4 - 3 - 2 - A and b) 7 - 6 - 5 - 4 - 3

Example ‘b’ is a better low hand – even without an ace, because the highest card in that hand is a 7. Whereas in example ‘a’, the highest low-card is an 8. 

If the highest low-cards in all low combinations are the same, the next highest card down will be the tiebreaker. For example, 8 - 4 - 3 - 2 - A and 8 - 5 - 3 - 2 – A. The first low hand wins, because the second low card is a 4, which is lower than the 5 in the second example. 

It is also possible for two or more players to have identical low hands. For example, 8-7-6-5-4 and 8-7-6-5-4. In this case, the 50% of the pot allocated to the best low hand would be split between those two players. They would each receive 25% of the pot."
Omaha HI/LO,Tip 2,omaha_hi_lo_tip_2,"If you are already familiar with Texas Hold'em rules, Omaha can seem very similar. However, it is very important to remember that a player must use any two – but only two - of their four hole cards along with any three of the community cards to form a hand."
Seven Card Stud,Tip 1,seven_card_stud_tip_1,"There are no community cards in a game of Seven Card Stud, unless, all 8 players remain active until the river round. There wouldn't be enough cards in the deck for each player to receive a final face down card. Therefore, one face-up community card is dealt on the poker table for all player to use to make a hand."
Seven Card Stud,Tip 2,seven_card_stud_tip_2,"The dealer position in a game of Seven Card Stud is not as important as in other poker games, because it does not determine the order of action. In Seven Card Stud, the first player to act starting from Fourth Street is the player with the highest-valued door cards. "
