Texas Holdem,Deal ,texas_holdem_deal,"Once all players are sat around a table with a relevant amount of chips, there are few steps to be taken before the game commences. 

Firstly, a player indicated by ‘the dealer’ marker (‘D') becomes the named dealer for the current game. The dealer acts last in betting rounds except from the pre-flop. 

Secondly, two compulsory bets are taken. The player to the left of the dealer button posts the first compulsory bet, called ‘the small blind’. The player to the left of the small blind posts the second compulsory bet, called ‘the big blind’.  Big blind is twice the amount of the small blind.

Finally, each player is dealt two face down hole cards.",texas_holdem_deal_0
