texas_holdem_deal,Dealer,1,texas_holdem_deal_1,"Dealer is a table position of the player who acts last in all betting rounds except from the pre-flop. It is also known as ‘dealer button’ or simply ‘button’ and is indicated with a ‘D’ marker. The dealer position is important because it determines the order in which the players bet.

The dealer is known to be the best table position. This is because the player in the dealer position can observe the actions of his opponents before his turn comes. It allows the player to analyse his opponents and make a decision based on their actions.

No need to worry if you are not chosen as the dealer at the beginning of a game. Dealer is a changing position which rotates clockwise around the table for each game round. When the first game round is over, the player to the left of the current dealer button becomes the dealer for the next game round.
