texas_holdem_deal,Dealer,1,texas_holdem_deal_1,28,10,"The Dealer is a table position assigned to the player who acts last in all betting rounds except pre-flop – as long as they choose to play the hand. It is also known as the ‘dealer button’ or simply the ‘button’ and is indicated by a ‘D’ marker. The dealer position is important because it determines the order in which players can act.

The dealer is known to be the best table position. The player in the dealer position can observe the actions of their opponents before it's their turn to act. It allows the player to analyse their opponents and make decisions based on their previous actions.

No need to worry if you are not chosen as the dealer at the beginning of a game. The dealer button rotates clockwise one position around the table after each hand. At the end of a hand, the player to the left of the current dealer button becomes the dealer for the next round."
texas_holdem_deal,Small Blind,2,texas_holdem_deal_2,79,10,"The small blind, marked as SB, is the first of the two initial forced bets in a game of Texas Hold'em. It is placed by the player immediately to the left of the dealer, and rotates after each hand to the next player, in a clockwise fashion. In a $10/$20 No Limit (NLHE) game, the small blind is equal to $10. However, in a Fixed Limit NLHE game, the SB is equal to one-half of the selected table’s lower betting limit. For example, if a table’s betting stake is $10/$20, the small blind would be $5."

For example, if a table’s betting stake is $10/$20, the small blind would be $10.
In NLHE games, the amount of the big blind is also the minimum bet in the current betting round. The small and big blinds are important because they incite the action and get the game going, since there's already money to vie for in the pot. "

However, if the all-in player wins the hand, they may not necessarily win all the money in the pot.

For example, one player bets $10; the second player has only $2. The second player moves all-in. The total pot is now $12. The second player wins the hand, but they can only claim the amount of their own bet plus the same amount from their opponent’s bet. In this example, the all-in player won $4 ($2 + $2).
